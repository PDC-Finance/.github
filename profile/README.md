# Blockpeer 🌍🚀

Welcome to **Blockpeer** on GitHub! Blockpeer began as **PDC Finance**, an ambitious hackathon project focused on financing future cash flows via tokenized assets. Recognized across the industry, PDC Finance secured awards from the **Moralis x Google Hackathon**, **Chainlink Spring Hackathon**, **JP Morgan Digital Identity Hackathon**, as well as grants from **Gelato** and **Unstoppable Domains**. This early vision laid the foundation for today’s Blockpeer ecosystem, transforming trade finance with blockchain innovation.

## The Evolution from PDC Finance to Blockpeer

PDC Finance’s core components have evolved into **Blockpeer Trade** and **Blockpeer Cliq**—two essential modules under Blockpeer that continue the mission of modernizing trade finance and asset tokenization.

### Blockpeer Trade: Tokenizing Trade Documents 📄➡️🔗

Building on PDC Finance’s original financing structure, Blockpeer Trade enables businesses to **tokenize key trade documents** such as e-invoices, bills of lading, and promissory notes. Compliant with MLETR and leveraging the TradeTrust framework, Blockpeer Trade supports secure, transparent, and compliant documentation to streamline global trade.

### Blockpeer Cliq: Trade Finance Marketplace 💸🔗

Blockpeer Cliq extends the financing vision, providing a **Trade Finance Marketplace** for tokenized assets. This module allows businesses to access funding using tokenized trade documents as collateral, connecting with a broad range of investors and allowing for both stablecoin and fiat options, expediting financing options for SMEs and larger entities alike.

### Blockpeer Books: Digital and Fiat Accounting 📊💰

Completing the Blockpeer suite, **Blockpeer Books** integrates comprehensive accounting capabilities for digital assets and fiat currencies. It empowers businesses with multi-asset management, exchange integrations, and traditional accounting tools, all in one unified platform.
