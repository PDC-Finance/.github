# PDC Finance 🌍🚀

Welcome to **PDC Finance**, the starting point of what has evolved into the [Blockpeer](https://www.blockpeer.finance/) ecosystem. Originally a hackathon project, PDC Finance was built with a mission to unlock future cash flow financing for businesses through tokenized assets and has since earned recognition across multiple hackathons and grants. Along the way, PDC Finance won awards at the **Moralis x Google Hackathon**, **Chainlink Spring Hackathon**, **JP Morgan Digital Identity Hackathon**, as well as grants from **Gelato** and **Unstoppable Domains**. These early successes provided the foundation for what is now an innovative suite of blockchain solutions under Blockpeer.

## From Hackathon Vision to Industry Solution

PDC Finance’s core components have evolved into **Blockpeer Trade** and **Blockpeer Cliq**, two powerful modules within the Blockpeer platform that continue to build on the project’s original mission of transforming trade finance through blockchain technology.

### Blockpeer Trade: Tokenizing Trade Assets 📄➡️🔗

Expanding on PDC Finance’s approach to financing future cash flows, Blockpeer Trade enables businesses to **tokenize trade assets**—including e-invoices, bills of lading, promissory notes, and more. With the TradeTrust framework, Blockpeer Trade provides MLETR-compliant documentation, bringing security, compliance, and transparency to the world of global trade.

### Blockpeer Cliq: Financing for Tokenized Trade Documents 💸🔗

With roots in PDC Finance’s financing mechanisms, Blockpeer Cliq connects tokenized assets to investors through a **Trade Finance Marketplace**. This module allows businesses to utilize tokenized trade documents as collateral, offering faster financing options and a wider range of investors, including crypto-native financiers. Both stablecoin and fiat options are available to meet varied business needs.

### Blockpeer Books: Integrated Digital and Fiat Accounting 📊💰

Completing the Blockpeer suite, **Blockpeer Books** offers a seamless accounting platform for digital assets and fiat transactions. It allows businesses to manage multi-asset ledgers, connect with crypto exchanges, and conduct traditional accounting in a unified, modern system.
